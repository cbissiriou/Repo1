## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(arrow)
```

load data

```{r}
scooby <- read_feather("scooby-do.arrow")
scooby
```


Training data

```{r}
library(tidymodels)

svm_spec <- svm_linear(mode = "classification")
scooby_rec <- 
  recipe(monster_real ~ year_aired + imdb, data = scooby) %>%
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())
svm_fit <-
  workflow(scooby_rec, svm_spec) %>%
  fit(scooby)

```
